### Get started quickly

###### Install react-stars package with NPM:
`npm install react-stars --save`

Then in your project include the component:

```javascript
import ReactStars from 'react-stars'
import React from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'

const ratingChanged = (newRating) => {
  console.log(newRating)
}

render(<ReactStars
  count={5}
  onChange={ratingChanged}
  size={24}
  color2={'#ffd700'} />,

  document.getElementById('where-to-render')
);
```
### Examples

##### Custom Size, Preset Number of Stars and Not Editable Component
```javascript
// Size of 30, 3 stars and uneditable component.
<Stars size={30} value={3} edit={false} />
```

##### Custom Characters, Custom Colors and Custom Total Number of Stars, onChange Method for Custom Logic.
```javascript
// Size of 40, 10 total stars, apple character, onChange method and editable component.
<Stars 
  size={40}
  count={10}
  color1="#ff9900"
  color2="#6599ff"
  edit={true}
  onChange={(newValue) => {
    console.log(newValue);
  }} 
/>
```

##### Custom Characters, Custom Colors and Custom Total Number of Stars without Half Stars
```javascript

<Stars 
  size={50}

/>
```

### Help improve the component

git clone git@github.com:n49/react-stars.git
# Go into project folder
cd react-stars
# Install dependancies
npm install
```
Build the component:

```

Then in your browser go to: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/example](http://127.0.0.1:8080/example)

### Requirements

You will need to have React in your project in order to use the component, I didn't bundle React in the build, because it seemed like a crazy idea.

### Todo

* Make better docs
* Better state management
* Write tests
