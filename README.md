### Get started quickly

###### Install react-stars package with NPM:
`npm install react-stars --save`

Then in your project include the component:

```javascript
import ReactStars from 'react-stars'
import React from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'

const ratingChanged = (newRating) => {
  console.log(newRating)
}

render(<ReactStars
  count={5},
  onChange={ratingChanged},
  size={24},
  color2={'#ffd700'} />,

  document.getElementById('where-to-render')
);
```
### API

This a list of props that you can pass down to the component:

| Property | Description | Default value | type |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- | ---- |
| `className`  | Name of parent class | `null` | string |
| `count`  | How many total stars you want  | 5 | number |
| `value`  | Set rating value  | 0 | number |
| `char` | Which character you want to use as a star | ★ | string |
| `color1` | Color of inactive star (this supports any CSS valid value) | `gray` | string |
| `color2` | Color of selected or active star | `#ffd700` | string |
| `size` | Size of stars (in px) | `15px` | string |
| `edit` | Should you be able to select rating or just see rating (for reusability) | `true` | boolean |
| `half` | Should component use half stars, if not the decimal part will be dropped otherwise normal algebra rools will apply to round to half stars | `true` | boolean
| `onChange(new_rating)` | Will be invoked any time the rating is changed | `null` | function |

### Help improve the component
###### Build on your machine:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:n49/react-stars.git
# Go into project folder
cd react-stars
# Install dependancies
npm install
```
Build the component:
```bash
npm build
```
Run the examples (dev):
```bash
npm run dev-example
```
Build the examples (production):
```bash
npm run build-example
```

Then in your browser go to: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/example](http://127.0.0.1:8080/example)

### Requirements

You will need to have React in your project in order to use the component, I didn't bundle React in the build, because it seemed like a crazy idea.

### Todo

* Make better docs
* Better state management
* Write tests
